I am postdoctoral research fellow interested in how computing technologies can be used to understand, monitor, and improve human health.
My work focuses on the development of wearable sensor-based technologies for objective assessment of motor function in several disease areas&mdash;including stroke, ataxia, and knee osteoarthritis.
In particular, I am working towards developing systems that unobtrusively and remotely assess motor performance, monitor disease trajectoies, and identify early disease signs.
My research integrates data analytics, machine learning, and biomedical engineering. I enjoy close collaborations with experts in neuroscience, neurology, and biomechanics.
In my free time, I enjoy playing automation and strategy video games and reading science fiction and fantasy.

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, where I worked in the [AHHA lab](http://www.ahhalab.org).
I received my undergraduate education at Louisiana State University, graduating with college honors and degrees in computer science and mathematics.
I am the recipient of nationally-competitive rewards, including the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and an honorable mention from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program.
