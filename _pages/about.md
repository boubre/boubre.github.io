I am postdoctoral research fellow interested in how computing technologies can be used to understand, monitor, and improve human health.
My work focuses on developing technologies for objective assessment of motor function in several disease areas&mdash;including stroke, ataxia, and knee osteoarthritis.
In particular, I am developing systems to unobtrusively and remotely assess motor performance, monitor disease trajectories, and identify early disease signs.
My research integrates data analytics, machine learning, and biomedical engineering. I enjoy close collaborations with experts in neuroscience, neurology, and biomechanics.
In my free time, I enjoy playing automation and strategy video games and reading science fiction and fantasy.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and was awarded the 2021&ndash;2022 Outstanding Dissertation Award by the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences.
I was a member of the [AHHA lab](http://www.ahhalab.org) during my doctoral studies.
<!-- I received my undergraduate education at Louisiana State University, graduating with college honors and degrees in computer science and mathematics. -->
I have also been the recipient of nationally-competitive rewards, including the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and an honorable mention from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program.
