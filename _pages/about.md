Brandon is a PhD candidate who joined the [AHHA lab](http://www.ahhalab.org) in 2017. He received his MS in computer science from UMass Amherst and has been awarded the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and an NSF GRFP Honorable Mention. Brandon is interested in the practical applications of machine learning and wearable sensing technology with regard to monitoring and improving human health. His research currently focuses on analyzing human motion in diseased populations (including stroke, parkinsonsism, ataxia, and knee osteoarthritis). His research goal is to develop technologies that can unobtrusively and remotely measure real-world motor performance in order to enable data-driven and patient-centered care.
