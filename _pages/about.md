I am Ph.D. candidate interested in how computing technologies can be used to understand, monitor, and improve human health.
My work currently focuses on the development of wearable sensor-based technologies for objective assessment of motor function in several disease areas&mdash;including stroke, ataxia, and knee osteoarthritis.
In particular, I am working towards developing systems that unobtrusively and remotely assess real-world motor performance, with a goal of enabling data-driven and patient-centered care.
My research integrates data analytics, machine learning, and biomedical engineering and I enjoy close collaborations with experts in neuroscience, neurology, and biomechanics.
In my free time, I enjoy playing automation and strategy video games and reading science fiction and fantasy.

I am currently a member of the [AHHA lab](http://www.ahhalab.org), which I joined in 2017.
I received my undergraduate education at Louisiana State University, graduating with college honors and degrees in computer science and mathematics.
I am the recipient of nationally-competitive rewards, including the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and an honorable mention from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program.
I was previously employed by CenturyLink and have completed internships at Biogen and NASA.
