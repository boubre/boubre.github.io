## CS 240, Reasoning Under Uncertainty
_Lead Teaching Assistant, Fall 2021_ <br />
_Teaching Assistant, Fall 2020_

Reasoning Under Uncertainty is a large (about 300 students), lower-division undergraduate course covering the fundamentals of counting, probability, and probabilistic reasoning.
This course is foundational for many advanced concepts in computer science including machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.
As one of six TAs, I held office hours and led weekly discussion sections that aimed to resolve student questions and reinforce course content.
As a lead TA, I was also responsible for ensuring a consistent, high quality student experience across discussion sections and for managing many aspects of course administration.


## CS 590W, Health Informatics and Data Science
_Teaching Assistant, Spring 2021_

Health Informatics and Data Science is a small (about 20 students), masters-level course tailored for students with both clinical and computational backgrounds.
As the sole TA during the first offering of this course, I worked closely with the instructors to develop course content (including hands-on projects) and administer the course.
The nature of this course also helped hone my ability to communicate across disciplinary barriers.
